# Requirement/ Necessity
Yesterday me and my friend was discussing over the issues in the current scenarios and we got one issue i.e the play schools. 
I mean why it's the need of todays era. 
People/parents are so busy in their professional and personal life, so they can't give enough time for their kids and that's the reason behind the play schools comes into picture. 

# Current situation
I am not sure what the kids are being teached or trained , but I am damn sure that they are definitely not teaching about our culture and the science behind it. 
Also the moral values like Bhagwadgita or the Vedas.
In today's era, where everyithing can be cured by medical science but this leads to a very dangerous issue like whenever you have small problems like headache or nausea or anything that can be cured by the home remedies or by Ayurveda and we are the generation(millenials) who saw everything(from using home remedies to the evolution of the world).
But now let's just keep away this topic because most of the parents won't allow their kids to be a practical instrument.
Now a days we are seeing there are lot of old age homes and its increasing day by day and there is same condition with the orphan age homes as well.

# What can be done
So coming back to the play school issue, I know they are teaching/training a lot and there are lot of games for them. 
But we should be truely concerned about our moral values, personality development, emotional development, culture and the human behaviour I think these all skills or experience our grandparents have. 
As many big people said "If you are smart you should learn from your mistakes and if you are smarter you should learn from others' mistakes", the old people have experience and time but our generation don't have time to share or get that experience, so what if our children can learn from their experiences about the human behaviour, moral values, personality and one thing that money can't buy is care.
No one care as much our grandparents care about us, because they have both emotional intelligence as well as the experience about nature and science.
